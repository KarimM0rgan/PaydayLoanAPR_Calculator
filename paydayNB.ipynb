    "With *annual percentage rates* (APRs) of 400-600 percent, payday loans carry some of the highest interest rates available on credit products.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an order of magnitude higher than a credit card (_e.g.,_ a typical credit card carries a 15-20% APR), and failure to pay off a payday loan on time is a common-enough occurrence that interest charges can be _much more_ than the actual amount borrowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "These lending percentage rates are not advertised and are not made readily available.  About 10 million American households borrow money through payday loans each year, and payday lenders have more storefronts in the United States than McDonald's and Starbucks combined (Pew Charitable Trusts 2012; Lusardi and de Bassa Scheresberg 2013). \n",

    "__How do payday loans work?__   A payday loan is a short-term loan that can help someone cover immediate cash needs until they receive their next paycheck. These loans are usually small-dollar, high-cost loans that charge a fee that is typically due within two weeks --- or close to the borrower's next payday.   Many people resort to payday loans because they're easy to get.  Borrowers who resort to obtaining payday loans may have poor credit or no credit, which can prevent them from getting a personal loan with better terms, for instance, from a bank.  Another reason may be a lack of knowledge about or fear of alternatives.  There are some alternatives but they are less profitable _for the lenders_ and therefore are less heavily advertised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Payday lenders have few requirements for approving the loans they give out. Most don't run a credit check or even require that the borrower have the means to repay the loan. All someone typically needs is identification, a bank account in relatively good standing, and a steady paycheck.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, many payday loan borrowers can't repay the debt by the due date. In fact, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that 20% of payday borrowers default on their loans (can't pay them back), and more than 80% of payday loans taken out by borrowers were rolled over or reborrowed within 30 days, perpetuating the cycle of debt."

    "\n",
    "Payday loan companies typically describe the terms and conditions of a loan in one of two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. The *loan amount* (the amount of cash the borrower receives), the *finance charge* (a fixed additional amount of money the borrower must repay, in addition to the loan amount), and the *repayment period* (the length of the loan in days or months, after which all the money must be repaid). \n",
